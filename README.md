Welcome to my GitHub repository.

I've been developing "commercial grade" applications for about 25 years.  I started before client/server was a thing.  Jumped on that bandwagon.  Built about half a dozen client/server applications complete with installation disks.  Was made a partner.  Saw PHP/LAMP would surpass that technology and shifted gears in that direction for another _(almost)_ 20 years now under my own company. The next big thing is clearly Jamstack/MEAN/MERN applications.  I still build and support PHP(LAMP) applications.  It's all about using the right tool for the job.

Please visit [My Blog](https://paulbonnette.app) for more information about me and [Commercial Grade](https://commercialgrade.com) if you want to contact me.  I'm always happy to help.
