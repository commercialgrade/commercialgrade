Welcome to my GitHub repository.

I'm sorry but there are no public projects available at this time.

I've been developing commercial grade applications for about 25 years.  

My current concentration is in Jamstack, MEAN, and MERN applications.

I have built and supported PHP (LAMP) applications for almost 20 years now.  Yes, that's a lot of code!

Please visit [My Blog](https://paulbonnette.app) for more information about me and [Commercial Grade](https://commercialgrade.com) if you need my help on a project.  I'm always happy to help.
